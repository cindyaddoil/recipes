Chinese steamed pork with rice flour. Fenzhengrou

Ingredients

500g around 1 lb. pork belly or other part with some fat
Green onion and fresh red pepper dices for garnishing (optional or you can use coriander )
2 middle size potatoes cut into small cubes
For the rice flour
1 star anise
1/2 cup of grain rice
10 whole Sichuan peppercorns
Sauce
1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
1 tablespoon light soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 inch root ginger, grated
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
1 tablespoon cooking wine
1 teaspoon chili pepper powder (optional)
Instructions

Wash grain rice and then drain.
Wash the pork belly carefully and then cut into thin slices. You can put it in refrigerator for half an hour before cutting. Then marinate with seasoning sauces. Set aside.
Mix drained grain rice with Sichuan peppercorn seeds, star anise. And then fry the mixtures in pan on medium heat until most of the rice grains become slightly brown. Pulverize the rice to powders using food processor or by hand.
Mix the pulverized rice with marinated pork.
Lay some fresh leaves (I am using the leaves for making Zongzi)or clean gauze and then potato cubs under your steamer. Then spread the pork slices evenly on potato cubes; steam with high fire for around 30 minutes.
Transfer out and garnish some chopped green onions and red peppers.
Notes

If you do not eat pork, you can choose beef. Then please extend the steaming time at least to 40 minutes depending on what protein you are using.
